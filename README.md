FactoryOS 10x shell is a UWP app that aims to accurately recreate the Windows 10X shell and experience in XAML/C#. The shell is designed to run under FactoryOS as part of my 10X revival project.

> [!NOTE]  
> Do note that everything will not be exactly 1:1 with 10X, but I do try my best.

## :package: Building
To build the 10X shell, you're gonna need a few things.
1. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 (any edition works)
2. Make sure you've installed the `.NET Desktop Development` workload, along with the `Universal Windows Platform` workload.
3. Open the 10x-shell project by clicking the `factoryos-10x-shell.sln` file in your file explorer.
4. At the top of Visual Studio, click the `Local Machine` button to compile and start the shell in Debug mode.

## üíø Installing
To install the shell independently, download the [latest release](https://github.com/Pdawg-bytes/factoryos-10x-shell/releases), then install the app package in the downloaded release.

> [!NOTE]  
> Since 10X shell is under development, you may not see any releases. Once a build is stable, it will be released.
